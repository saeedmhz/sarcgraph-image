# Z-Disc Classifiers

This folder contains all components specifically related to contour generation, feature extraction, and classification of z-disc regions. It is part of a larger repository (`repo/`) that includes other components as well.

## Subfolders and Files:
- **`contour_visualizations/`**: Contains visualized contour images for verification.
- **`dino/`**: Scripts and trained models related to feature extraction and classification using the DINOv2 model.
- **`output/`**: Intermediate data generated during contour and z-disc segmentation.
- **`processed-raw-cell/`**: Processed raw cell images, including contour images and z-disc data.
- **`simclr/`**: Placeholder for components related to SimCLR-based training of the EfficientNetV2-S model.

This folder is self-contained and focuses on tasks related to z-disc classification.
